"Whenever you bake or cook, you have to use scales to weigh the ingredients.",Measuring mass in g and kg
"If you didn’t use the correct amount of flour in a cake, it would not taste nice!When measuring mass, you use grams and kilograms.1000 g = 1 kgWhen you’re reading scales, you have to look really carefully at the intervals (divisions) between the numbers.",Measuring mass in g and kg
This is so you can identify which numbers they represent.The scales tell you whether you are reading grams or kilograms.,Measuring mass in g and kg
Take a look at the scales below.,Measuring mass in g and kg
"When reading scales, the first thing you have to do is look at the intervals.",Measuring mass in g and kg
What are the divisions going up in?The larger intervals go up in hundreds.,Measuring mass in g and kg
You can also see there is a smaller interval in between each hundred.,Measuring mass in g and kg
This must be worth 50 g since it is the halfway point between hundreds.,Measuring mass in g and kg
"The arrow on the dial is pointing at the smaller division between 700 g and 800 g, so the mass of the fruit must be 750 g This time, the scales are in kilograms.",Measuring mass in g and kg
"The arrow is between 2 kg and 3 kg, but what do the intervals represent?",Measuring mass in g and kg
"The kilograms are split up into 10 divisions, so each one must represent 100 g, since 10 lots of 100 g is 1 kg.The arrow is on the third division after 2 kg, so the weight of the potatoes is 2kg 300gWhat would 2 kg 300 g be in just grams?2 kg is the same as 2000 g. So: 2000 g + 300 g = 2300 g How would you draw an arrow to represent the mass of 7 kg and 800 g?First thing to do is work out what the smaller divisions represent in-between the whole kilograms.The kilograms are split up into 10 divisions, so each one must represent 100g.Now, you have to find the 8th division after 7kg and draw an arrow to represent 7kg 800g.Like this: Test yourself with this quiz on grams and kilograms.",Measuring mass in g and kg

A litre is much more than a millilitre.1 litre = 1000 millilitresWe shorten litres to ‘l’ and we can shorten millilitres to 'ml'.So we might also say:1 l = 1000 ml After pouring 2l of juice into this jug the jug is half full.The volume of juice in the jug is 2l because that is how much liquid is in the container.The capacity of the jug is 4l because that is how much the jug can contain.,Measuring capacity
The capacity of this glass is smaller than the jug.,Measuring capacity
The glass holds less than 1 litre so we measure the liquid in this glass in millilitres.,Measuring capacity
The capacity of the glass is 250ml and the volume of juice in the glass is 200ml.,Measuring capacity
RememberCapacity is the amount of liquid a container can hold.,Measuring capacity
Volume is how much liquid is in the container.We can measure in both millilitres and litres.,Measuring capacity
"What's left in the house?Find as many containers in your kitchen as you can that are holding liquids, such as a bottle of milk or squash.Check how much liquid they hold when they are full (you should be able to find this on the packaging.)",Measuring capacity
"Estimate how much liquid is left in each container.If possible, use a measuring jug for each to check your estimates.",Measuring capacity
"Drinks timeUsing a measuring jug, make yourself a drink.",Measuring capacity
"For example, you could use the recipe below:½ litre orange juice50 ml cranberry juice200 ml water5 ml lemon juiceWhy not adapt this recipe to use the drinks you have at home?",Measuring capacity
Volume is the amount of space a 3D shape takes up.We measure volume in cubic centimetres (cm3) or cubic metres (m3).Capacity is the amount a shape or container can hold.We measure capacity in millilitres (ml) or litres (L).,Volume and capacity
One millilitre is the amount of liquid that would fill one centimetre cube.,Volume and capacity
Jacob has nine one centimetre cubes and builds a cuboid that measures 3cm by 3cm by 1cm.He makes two further cuboids the same size as this first one and stacks the three cuboids on top of one another as shown to make a cube.The cube measures 3cm by 3cm by 3cm.,Volume and capacity
How do we find the volume of the large cube?There are nine cubes on each layer and there are three layers.9 x 3 = 27 so Jacob has used 27 centimetre cubes to make the larger cube.,Volume and capacity
This can also be calculated by multiplying: 3 (the number of cubes along one edge) by3 (the number of cubes along another edge) by3 (the large cube is three cubes high).,Volume and capacity
If the volume of each small cube is 1cm3 then the volume of the larger cube is 27cm3.,Volume and capacity
What is the capacity of this cube in litres?,Volume and capacity
What is the volume of the cube?V = L x W x H so V = 10cm x 10cm x 10cmV = 1000cm3What is the capacity of the cube?We know that 1cm3 = 1ml.,Volume and capacity
We also know that the volume of this cube is 1000cm3 so this means that this cube will hold 1000ml of liquid.1000 millilitres = 1 litre so the capacity of this cube in litres = 1L.,Volume and capacity
"Height × width × depth = volumeIf the height, width and depth are measured in cm, the answer will be cm³.If the height, width and depth are measured in m, the answer will be m³",How to calculate volume

In this lesson we will use our knowledge of place value to order and compare amounts of money.For some questions you may need to convert between pounds and pence.,Compare and order amounts of money
£1 = 100p.,Compare and order amounts of money
That means that when we convert from pounds to pence we x by 100 and when we convert from pence to pounds we ÷ by 100.,Compare and order amounts of money
"Is 428p greater than, less than or the same as £4.82?",Compare and order amounts of money
To compare the two amounts we need to convert both to the same unit of measure.,Compare and order amounts of money
"In this example, we are going to convert the pounds into pence.",Compare and order amounts of money
To go from pounds to pence we multiply by 100 so the calculation is 4.82 x 100.,Compare and order amounts of money
This place value chart can help us work out the answer.,Compare and order amounts of money
"When we multiply by 100, each of the digits moves 2 places to the left so we can see that 4.82 x 100 = 482.",Compare and order amounts of money
Now we have converted from pounds to pence the next step is to use our knowledge of place value to compare the two numbers.,Compare and order amounts of money
When we compare we start with the column furthest to the left.Both numbers have 4 hundreds so we move along to the tens.428p has 2 tens and 482p has 8 tens.,Compare and order amounts of money
8 tens are bigger than 2 tens so 482 is the bigger number.,Compare and order amounts of money
This means the completed statement is 428p < £4.82.,Compare and order amounts of money
In this slideshow we will compare 3 amounts of money and place the amounts in ascending order.,Compare and order amounts of money

It's much easier to add whole pounds in our head instead of adding pounds and pence.We can use our knowledge of rounding numbers to help us estimate costs.,Estimating money
Joe orders a slice of cake costing £3.80.What is £3.80 rounded to the nearest pound?We're going to use a number line to see if £3.80 should be rounded up or rounded down.,Estimating money
This number line has been labelled with the nearest pounds on either end and each mark on the number line represents 10p.,Estimating money
To round £3.80 to the nearest pound we place it on a number line.Whichever whole number it is closer to on the number line is the number we round it to.,Estimating money
You could also look at the tenths column to decide if you should round up or round down.,Estimating money
If the number in the tenths column is 5 or bigger then you round up.If the number in the tenths column is 4 or less then you round down.,Estimating money
There are 8 tenths in £3.80 so we round up.,Estimating money
If Joe's cake had cost £2.49 or less we would round down.,Estimating money
"Knowing how to estimate costs is useful when we are shopping and need to check if we have enough money.Joe is shopping for food for his packed lunch and this is the cost of items in his local supermarket.ItemCostCheese£3.70Melon£2.25Strawberries£2.75Crisps£4.55Eggs£1.95 What is the cost of the cheese and the cake to the nearest pound?For both of these items we round up because they both have tenths above 5.Cheese = £4Eggs = £2Now we’ve rounded the cost of the cheese and eggs to the nearest pound, what is the approximate total cost of the cheese and eggs?",Estimating money
"4 +2 = £6 Estimating costs can also help us work out how much change we'll receive.Joe wants to buy strawberries, crisps and melon.Approximately how much change will he receive if he pays with £20?Round the items to the nearest pound Add the approximate cost (the rounded numbers) of all of the items together Subtract this from 20Is your answer £10?",Estimating money

Watch this video to learn about analogue time (the 12 hour clock) and digital time (the 24 hour clock).,The 12 and 24 hour clock
A clock with hands (an analogue clock) shows us the numbers 1-12.,The 12 and 24 hour clock
"There are 24 hours in one day, so we measure time by splitting the day into two halves.The first 12 hours of the day, from midnight to midday , are called AM.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"The next 12 hours, from midday back to midnight, are called PM.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"AM is short for ante meridiem, which means 'before midday'.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"PM is short for post meridiem, meaning 'after midday'.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"If we want to talk about something that happens during the morning, we say the time but add 'AM' after it - for example, 'I eat my breakfast at 8 o'clock AM'.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"And then to talk about something during the afternoon or evening, we add PM after the time, so we could say 'I go to bed at 7 o'clock PM'.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"We can tell the time without saying AM and PM though - for this, we use the 24 hour clock.The 24 hour clock always uses 4 digits, and we use this system most often with digital clocks.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"For any time before 10 o'clock in the morning, a zero is placed at the beginning.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"The first two digits show the hour and the last two digits show the minutes.We don't use AM or PM here, because the time shows all the hours in a 24 hour day.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"06:45 means 45 minutes past the 6th hour of the day, or 6:45 AM.12:30 means 30 minutes past the 12th hour of the day, or 12.30 PM.",The 12 and 24 hour clock
"To convert from the 12 hour clock to the 24 hour clock is easy - you just need to add 12 to the hours in the day after midday.For example:2 o'clock PM becomes 14:00, as 2 + 12 = 14.8 o'clock PM becomes 20:00, as 8 + 12 = 20.To convert from the 24 hour clock to a PM time in the 12 hour clock, just subtract 12:19:00 becomes 7 o'clock PM, as 19 - 12 = 7.",The 12 and 24 hour clock

The orientation following this transformation is unchanged.The triangle ABC and the triangle A¹B¹C¹ are congruent.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
Now look at this next grid.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
"The parallelogram PQRS is positioned in the first and fourth quadrants.The co-ordinates of the parallelogram are P(2,5), Q(5,3), R(5,-4) and S(2,-2).The triangle PQRS has been reflected in the y axis (line of reflection).",Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
The resulting image of this reflection has been labelled P¹Q¹R¹S¹.Each point on the original shape is the same distance from the line of reflection as the corresponding point on the image.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
The corresponding points are opposite one another following this ‘flip’.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
The two parallelograms are the same size and shape.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
"However, this transformation has changed the orientation of the original shape.The parallelogram PQRS and the parallelogram P¹Q¹R¹S¹ are congruent.",Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
Look at this final grid.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
The L shape (irregular hexagon) labelled 1 is positioned in the first quadrant.This shape is then reflected in a line that is parallel to the y axis.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants
This line of reflection is called the line x=-1This is because the x coordinate of every point on the line will always be -1.The resulting image has been labelled 2.Now another reflection!The L shape labelled 2 is now reflected in the x axis.The resulting image has been labelled 3.All three L shapes are the same shape and size and therefore they are all congruent.,Translating and reflecting in four quadrants

It is possible to position a point on a grid using a pair of numbers or co-ordinates.A pair of co-ordinates is an example of an ordered pair since it is important which way around we write the two numbers!,Describe positions in the four quadrants
"Which number gets written first and which number gets written second – it matters.So, for example, a point with the co-ordinates (2,3) is a different place to a point with the co-ordinates (3,2).The grid below shows a pair of axes, dividing a grid into four parts, or quadrants.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
The x axis is the horizontal axis.,Describe positions in the four quadrants
In this example the x axis is numbered from -3 to 3.The y axis is the vertical axis.,Describe positions in the four quadrants
"In this example the y axis is also numbered from -3 to 3.The two axes intersect at right angles at the point we call the origin – or the place that we start from when we look to position a point with a given co-ordinate.The letter P positions a point with co-ordinates (2, 3).",Describe positions in the four quadrants
"This point is located in the first quadrant.The letter Q positions a point with co-ordinates (3, 2).",Describe positions in the four quadrants
This point is also located in the first quadrant.,Describe positions in the four quadrants
"The four quadrants are labelled as shown – the First Quadrant, the Second Quadrant, the Third Quadrant and finally the Fourth Quadrant.Only in the first quadrant will both the x and y co-ordinates be positive.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
Negative co-ordinates will be introduced to positive points in the other three co-ordinates.,Describe positions in the four quadrants
"The point A is positioned in the first quadrant.The co-ordinates of A are (1,3)We can just write this as A(1,3)The point B is positioned in the second quadrant.The co-ordinates of B are (-3,3)We can just write this as B(-3,3) The point C is positioned in the third quadrant.The co-ordinates of C are (-3,-2)We can just write this as C(-3,-2)The point D is positioned in the fourth quadrant.The co-ordinates of D are (1,-2)We can just write this as D(1,-2)The four points could be joined, A to B, B to C, C to D and finally D to A to form the rectangle ABCD.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
"The diagram above shows a square EFGH.The point E is positioned in the second quadrant.The co-ordinates of E are (-2,4)We can just write this as E(-2,4)The point F is positioned in the first quadrant.The co-ordinates of F are (3,2)We can just write this as F(3,2)The point G is positioned in the fourth quadrant.The co-ordinates of G are (1,-3)We can just write this as G(1,-3) The point H is positioned in the third quadrant.The co-ordinates of H are (-4,-1)We can just write this as H(-4,-1) The diagram above shows an isosceles triangle, LMN.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
"The co-ordinates of the vertices of the triangle are: L(4,5), M(4,1) and N(-4,3).If the triangle is reflected in the x axis then the co-ordinates of the reflected image would be L¹(4,-5), M¹(4,-1) and N¹(-4,-3).",Describe positions in the four quadrants
"So, when reflected in the x axis, we have: Look at what happens to the x and y co-ordinates when points are reflected in the x axis.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
"The x co-ordinate stays the same, whereas the y co-ordinate 'changes sign’, i.e.",Describe positions in the four quadrants
if it was positive it now becomes negative and if it was negative it changes to positive!We could generalise and say:,Describe positions in the four quadrants
There are lots of ways to visualise data.,How can data be displayed?
An important ‘life skill’ is that we know how to read and understand information offered to us in a variety of different formats and styles.Here we are going to focus on understanding the information provided in different types of timetables!,Interpreting timetables
Josh wants to travel from Newcastle to Edinburgh.He wants to leave Newcastle in the afternoon.The timetable opposite shows the times of some of the available trains that travel directly from Newcastle to Edinburgh.,Interpreting timetables
"The earliest available train leaves Newcastle at 39 minutes past 12 or 12:39 (24 hour clock) If it arrives on time, it will get into Edinburgh at 13 minutes past 2 or 14:13 (24 hour clock) To calculate the journey time for this train, he makes the following sketch: The train leaves at 21 minutes before 1pm.",Interpreting timetables
The time between 1pm and 13 minutes past 2 is 1 hour and 13 minutes.The total journey time is 21 minutes + 1 hour and 13 minutes = 1 hour and 34 minutes.,Interpreting timetables
The bus timetable below shows some of the bus times for the village of Thornton and the surrounding areas.This is circular route - the buses start and finish at the local bus station or interchange.The timetable shows the times of the buses that leave the bus station between 6am and 7am.,Interpreting timetables
"There are five sets of bus times shown on this timetable.The first bus leaves Thornton Interchange at 6am, the second at 6:15am, the third at half past 6, the fourth at 6:45am and the fifth at 7amThe buses that leave the interchange at half past 6 and a quarter to 7 make two fewer stops than buses that leave at other times.The planned total journey time for three of the buses is 65 minutes.",Interpreting timetables
"For the two buses that make two fewer stops, the total journey time is 58 minutes.",Interpreting timetables
"Here’s a different type of timetable – very personal to one individual!Rather than attending school, Harry spent time at home during lockdown like many other children.To help him structure his time during the day he decided to prepare a timetable.",Interpreting timetables
The aim was that he had time to keep up with his school work and time when he can ‘chill’ and do things he really enjoys to help him relax.What would your daily timetable look like?,Interpreting timetables
We know that we can display information in many different ways.,Pie charts
"We might write a list, summarise information in a table, draw a bar chart or line graph, thinking carefully about the scales on both axes, and so on!A pie chart is just another example of how we could represent data pictorially.",Pie charts
"Pie charts show proportions, i.e.",Pie charts
a fraction of a whole and NOT total amounts.,Pie charts
"Fractions, decimals and percentages are examples of proportions.",Pie charts
The circle (360 degrees) represents the whole and the separate parts (or sectors) fit together to make the whole (circle).,Pie charts
Line graphs and bar charts are examples of statistical diagrams where we can read the amounts by just interpreting the scales on the given axes.In this part of mathematics we learn to understand why some ways of displaying data may be more effective than others.,Pie charts
A school decides to organise a special event for all Year 6 pupils in their last term of primary school.,Pie charts
The pupils can choose just one of three different options.The pie chart below shows the results.,Pie charts
Let’s consider whether the following statements are TRUE or FALSE.25% of Y6 pupils chose the Museum of Natural History.,Pie charts
"This is true!If 16 pupils chose the Wildlife Park and this is 20% of all the Y6 pupils, then this means that the pie chart represents a total of 80 pupils.",Pie charts
This is true!,Pie charts
(20% is equivalent to one fifth and one fifth of 80 is 16)60% of the pupils chose the Activity Centre.,Pie charts
This is false!,Pie charts
"One whole = 100%, so the correct answer is 55% because 55% + 25% + 20% = 100%The angle of the sector representing the Wildlife Park is 72°.",Pie charts
This is true!,Pie charts
20% of 360?,Pie charts
"10% of 360 = 36, so 20% of 360 = 36 x 2 = 72The fraction of the whole pie chart that represents the Activity Centre is eleven twentieths.",Pie charts
This is true!,Pie charts
"55% = 55/100 which cancels down to 11/20 In this example, there are two pie charts.",Pie charts
This is because we want to compare the results of two different schools.Both schools have decided to collect and then display information about recycling ‘Tin cans’ and ‘Plastic bottles’ in their respective schools.,Pie charts
"Once again, let’s consider whether the following statement is TRUE or FALSE.In School A, more plastic bottles were recycled than in School B.This could be true or it could be false!This is because we have not been told the total amount of items that have been recycled in each school!",Pie charts
"If we knew the total of items, then we could work out what each the amount each sector represents for both of the schools.However, it would be true to say that in School A, a greater proportion of plastic bottles were recycled than in School B.",Pie charts
The pie chart below represents the number of pupils in three different classes in a school.,Pie charts
We are also told the angle of the sector for each of the three classes: Class 1 has the fewest pupils.,Pie charts
Class 3 has the most pupils.,Pie charts
"If the total number of pupils in all three classes was 72, then we can work out:One child in the school is represented by 5 degrees because 72 x 5 = 360 or 360 ÷ 72 = 5There are 20 children in Class 1 because 100 ÷ 5 = 20There are 24 children in Class 2 because 120 ÷ 5 = 24There are 28 children in Class 3 because 140 ÷ 5 = 28Check: 20 + 24 + 28 = 72",Pie charts
"Take a look at this graph, what information is it telling us?",Introducing line graphs
The horizontal axis is the bottom axis and moves from left to right.This horizontal axis in this example is labelled Time and the time increases as we move along the line.,Introducing line graphs
What information is the vertical axis telling us?,Introducing line graphs
This axis is labelled Temperature in °C.,Introducing line graphs
"It starts at 0, meaning 0°C.The next label is 2 so we know that the scale goes up in steps of 2°C.",Introducing line graphs
The label is counting in 2s but that doesn’t mean that 7°C or 9°C isn’t on there.,Introducing line graphs
The odd numbers like 7°C or 9°C can still be measured on graph they just aren't labelled.,Introducing line graphs
What was the temperature at 10am?,Introducing line graphs
First slide along the horizontal axis to find 10am.Travel straight up from 10am until you meet the line.,Introducing line graphs
We are reading the temperature so we start from where we meet the line and travel across until we meet the vertical axis.Now we can read the vertical axis to see that the temperature at 10am was 4°C.,Introducing line graphs
When was the temperature 16°C?This time we know the temperature but not the time.,Introducing line graphs
First we slide up the vertical axis to 16°C and travel across to meet the line.Then we travel straight down to reach the horizontal axis which reads 4pm.It was 16°C at 4pm.,Introducing line graphs
Take a look at the graph again.,Introducing line graphs
When was it 10°C?,Introducing line graphs
It was 10°C at 1pm.Did you notice another time of the day when the temperature was 10°C?Keep travelling across the line once you've reached 1pm and you will see that it was also 10°C at 2.30pm.This means there are two times when the temperature was 10°C.,Introducing line graphs
It is important to include a title when drawing a graph as this provides us with more information about what the graph is showing.,Introducing line graphs
In this quiz you will solve some problems using information you have taken from a line graph.,Introducing line graphs
